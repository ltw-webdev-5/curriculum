goal:
  before: |
    We’re going to explore a bunch of SEO concepts on a fake website so we can look at the important tags & content and see how to improve the search engine juice.

    **All these techniques will later be applied to your portfolio website.**

steps:
  - title: "Set up the project"
    before: |
      We’re going to take an mostly complete website and enhance it by adding better SEO and metadata to the code.

      You should see the following files in the folder that you’ve cloned:
    folders:
      - label: "robot-parts-co"
        type: folder
      - label: "css"
        type: folder
        indent: 1
      - label: "main.css"
        indent: 2

        text: "Don’t forget to follow the [naming conventions](/topics/naming-paths-cheat-sheet/#naming-conventions)."

  - title: "Rename some files"
    before: |
      One thing that search engines look at when trying to determine the topic and keywords of your page is the URLs, and the words in the URLs.

      We should rename some of these files to be better for search engines.
    folders:
      - label: "robot-parts-co"

      - label: "css"
        type: folder

        indent: 2

        fade: true
      - label: "page2.html"
        indent: 1
        rename: "robot-parts.html"
        notes: "More descriptive"
      - label: "page3.html"

      **Don’t forget to change all the references in the HTML.**

  - title: "Improve the <title> tags"
    before: |
      The `<title>` tag is one of the most important pieces of content from an SEO perspective: it’s searched for keywords and it’s used on the search results pages.

      We need to make nice, keyword heavy `<title>` tags that are *completely unique on every page of the website*.

  - title: "Add <meta> descriptions"
    before: |
      The `<meta>` description tag should be included on all websites—and be completely unique on every page.

      Search engines use this as the little description under the link on search results pages. Or sometimes, if it’s better, they’ll use the first few words from the first `<p>` tag.

      Max length for the `<meta>` description is 150 characters.

              Since the logo is inside the `<h1>` the `alt=""` attribute is extremely important—it should be the name of the company only.

              The titles of pages in the navigation is really important—“Products” is too generic so we’ll change it to “Robot Parts”.

          - num: 3
            text: |
              Every page must have a completely unique `<h1>`—that means that the logo cannot be an `<h1>` tag on the inside pages because it would match the homepage.

              So, on inside pages, the logo should probably be a `<strong>` tag.
          - num: 14
            text: |
              Now that the `<h1>` tag has been freed from the logo, we should use it on the most important piece of content on this page: the page title.

              While we’re at it, let’s change the title to be slightly more descriptive than “Products”.
    after: |
      **Go ahead and make the `<h1>` to `<strong>` adjustment on the `contact.html` page too. Then change the `<h2>` to an `<h1>`.**

  - title: "Homepage content fixes"
    before: |
      Looking at the homepage there’s a few adjustments we can do to the content to make it more search engine friendly.

      - num: 5
        text: |
          The website introductory paragraph was really generic—we changed it to something more relevant.

          Also, since it’s an important paragraph and search engines pay attention to `<strong>` tags we surrounded it with a `<strong>` tag.
      - num: 6
        text: |
          The `<img>` tag should have a really descriptive, keyword laden `alt=""` attribute to help with search results.
      - num: 7
        text: |
          The text inside the `<a>` tag was too generic so we changed it to something more descriptive of the page we’re linking too.

  - title: "Add location information"
    before: |
      It’s helpful for search engines to know the location of the website, especially if it’s a physical business. They can use that information to plot on maps, etc.

      There are a few tags to define the geographic location using longitude & latitude:
    code_lang: "html"
    code_file: "index.html"
    code: |
      ⋮
        <link href="css/main.css" rel="stylesheet">

        fade: true
      - num: "3,4"
        text: |
          Add the longitude & latitude of the physical location—or even just the city.
      - num: 5
        text: |
          Specify the region’s country code: `ca-on` means “Canada, Ontario”.
      - num: 6
        text: |
          Specify the city, village, town, etc. of the location.
    after: |
      **Make sure to copy this to the `robot-parts.html` & `contact.html`**

  - title: "Add social media tags"
    before: |
      When somebody shares our website on social media we can control what information shows in the share box by adding a few more `<meta>` tags to the head of our document.

      There are primarily 2 chunks of information: [OpenGraph](https://ogp.me/)—used by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn & more.

      *(Though there are few specific ones for [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started). Twitter actually has duplicated many of the OpenGraph tags—but they’re totally optional.)*
    code_lang: "html"

      - num: "3-9"
        text: |
          These are the OpenGraph tags. They’ll work on just about any social media website, including Twitter.
      - num: "10-11"
        text: |
          Twitter has a few of its own extra tags to add, these are the two that are kind of necessary. The rest of the data will be pulled from OpenGraph.
    after: |
      Copy this to the `robot-parts.html` & `contact.html`. **It’s extremely critical that `og:title`, `og:url` & `og:description` are different for every page.** I usually just copy from the other `<meta>` tags.

  - title: "Humans.txt"
    before: |
      The `humans.txt` file is a place to write the credits of your website: the designers, developers, etc.

      **It’s also a wonderful place to cite the location of where you got assets.** If you downloaded icons from a website you need to specify where, when, etc.—like a bibliography.

  - title: "Robots.txt"
    before: |
      The `robots.txt` file is for search engine crawlers—to prevent them from showing certain things in search results. *Remember only honest search engines will follow the specifications.*

      For instance, if you don’t want to have your images show in image search results you could block your images folder.

      Here’s the most basic one you should have: it says, “Don’t block anything”.

      Also notice it’s pointing to our `sitemap.xml`—that’s the next step.

  - title: "Search engine sitemap"
    before: |
      The `sitemap.xml` file is used by search engines to help them spider your website. It’s a large list of all the pages on the website.

      **This is different than a user-facing sitemap.** It’s specifically targeted at search engine robots & not humans. The visual sitemap you’ve interacted with previously is another thing that you should probably include.
    folders:

          Every page on the website should have its own `<url>` entry.

          The only tag within that is required is `<loc>`: the URL of the page itself—the other tags are optional.

          - `lastmod`: The last modification day of the page
          - `changefreq`: How often the page changes
          - `priority`: How important the page is, the default is `0.5`

        text: |
          Add 2 more `<url>` blocks here for the contact & robot-parts pages.

      **Don’t forget to add 2 more `<url>` blocks:**

      1. One `<url>` block for `contact.html`
      1. One `<url>` block for `robot-parts.html`

  - title: "Add extra metadata"
    before: |
      The contact page has the address and contact information for the store, it’s a great idea to add extra [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) metadata to help computers (and robots) understand the content better.

          Add a new `<script>` tag & set its type to `application/ld+json`

          If we don’t set the `type` attribute the browser will try to execute it as JavaScript.

        text: |
          There are a few different definitions here, each for a distinct part of a postal address:

          - `streetAddress` — the building number & street name.
          - `addressLocality` — the city or village or hamlet, etc. — e.g. “Ottawa”
          - `addressRegion` — province, territory, state, canton, etc. — e.g. “Ontario”
          - `addressCountry` — the country of the address — e.g. “Canada”.
          - `postalCode` — that one’s pretty obvious.
