      ## What’s a 404

      `404` is a technical error message from HTTP

      Error code 404 means: “Not found”

      `404` error pages are a last resort—your user should, ideally, never see it

      ## Other HTTP status codes

      `200` — “OK”, page is found and sent

      `301` — “Moved permanently”, you’re getting redirected to another URL

      `401` — “Unauthorized”, page is password protected

      `500` — “Internal server error”, the server ran into a problem

      ## Great 404 pages are…

      **Helpful** — Explain to the user what happened, how to solve it, hints at where to go

      **Fast** — Don’t make the user wait for the 404 page to load, they already can’t get what they want

      **Fun** — Getting a 404 sucks, have some personality and fun for the user
