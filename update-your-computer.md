  - title: "Update Google Chrome"
    before: |
      Google Chrome does update itself when you quit it, but sometimes it stays running and never gets updated. So let’s check for updates anyways.

      ```
      Chrome > About Google Chrome
      ```

      ![](chrome-menu.jpg)

      Make sure you have the most recent version—if not install and restart Chrome.

  - title: "Update Firefox"
    before: |
      Firefox does update itself when you quit it, but sometimes it stays running and never gets updated—or it just hasn’t been open in a while. Let’s check for updates anyways.

      ```
      Firefox > About Firefox
      ```

      ![](firefox-menu.jpg)

      Make sure you have the most recent version—if not install and restart Firefox.

  - title: "Update Opera"
    before: |
      If you’re not an Opera user, you probably haven’t opened Opera in a while—so it’ll be very outdated.

      ```
      Opera > About Opera
      ```

      ![](opera-menu.jpg)

      Make sure you have the most recent version—if not install and restart Firefox.

  - title: "Update Adobe Creative Cloud apps"
    before: |
      For Web Dev, it’s important that you at least update Illustrator & Photoshop to the newest versions—they’re constantly changing their web exporting tools.

      Open the Adobe Creative Cloud app and go to the `Apps` tab. *Press the `Update All` button.*

  - title: "Update VirtualBox"
    before: |
      VirtualBox has updates every little while so let’s make sure we have the newest version.

      ```
      VirtualBox > Check for Updates…
      ```

      ![](virtualbox-menu.jpg)

      *The VirtualBox updates are pretty manual—they usually just download a new installer to your `Downloads` folder that you’ll have to run.*

  - title: "Update ImageOptim"
    before: |
      We always want to compress our images as small as possible—so let’s update ImageOptim to get the best smushing abilities.

      ImageOptim > Check for Updates…
      ```

      ![](imageoptim-menu.jpg)

      Make sure you have the most recent version of ImageOptim or install the new one.
